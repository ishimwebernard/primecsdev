              <h2>1.	Background</h2>
              <p>

                The most common cause of failure on large infrastructure development projects remains the lack of proper organization.  This is in addition to a shortage of competent professionals, an industrywide reluctance to consider and adopt innovative solutions, and a lack of knowledge of international codes and standards. Historically, humans were multidisciplined master builders skilled to design, build, and operate infrastructure. As we evolved, infrastructure became too complex for a traditional master builder. Currently, design and construction teams comprise a large number of specialists - individuals with an in-depth knowledge, often of only their own specialty.  This, regrettably, has made it easier to revert to an uncollaborative, siloed mentality that often neglects to work toward holistic, integrated design and construction solutions.  Efforts to correct this cost excessive time and money. 
                <br>
                Today, the rise of megaprojects designed for 100 years or longer requires advanced sophistication and expeditious delivery. Efficiency, economy, integration, and strict adherence to standards and codes are now expected.  This situation begs the return of a master-builder who can unify diverse teams and integrate objectives and technologies for the best possible solution.  Such a master-builder takes a whole-life approach and considers the asset's design, construction, operation, and maintenance. This reinvention remains unfamiliar to many. Particularly, Africa and other developing regions have an opportunity to adapt swiftly and shape a future built on a solid footing.

              <h2>2.	AEC360 LI Overview</h2>
              <p>
                The AEC360 Learning Initiative (AEC360 LI) is a unique educational initiative created by PrimECS LLC, a US-based infrastructure consultant providing construction engineering, management, and educational services.  AEC360 LI strengthens technical competencies and studies the integrated master-builder delivery (alternative delivery) approach for large infrastructure projects. We promote project integration beyond traditional collaboration and coordination while providing local and international self-growth opportunities in the AEC industry. Once graduated, participants are welcomed into our highly interactive community, where we continue to grow and exchange experiences via:<br>
	professional development events - seminars, conferences, masterminds, and study trips;<br>
	coaching, mentoring, and self-directed learning guidance; and <br>
	AEC industry-related content creation and publishing. <br>

                
              </p>
              <h2>3.	 Mission and Objectives</h2>
              <p>
                Starting with Rwanda, we connect African and US-based resources to promote the exchange of skills and opportunities. We lead the infrastructure industry through the 21st century's social, economic, and technological evolutions while creating opportunities for the less affluent. We do so by: <br>
	inspiring young talent to seize AEC industry opportunities for professional and personal fulfillment;<br>
	growing current and future AEC professionals and leaders to internationally competitive levels; and<br>
	providing infrastructure builders with a pool of highly competent project leaders and experts.<br>

              </p>
              <h2>4.	Key Programs </h2>
              <p>
                We currently offer the following primary programs:
	AEC360 Pro: Designed for University students and professionals with less than five years of experience, this entry-level program introduces the AEC industry's fundamentals, providing required skills to realize a full project delivery cycle from inception to closeout.  We confer on what we do and how to do it best.  The first cohort began the program in October 2020.
	AEC360 Expert: This intermediate-level program generally caters to AEC professionals with more than five years of experience.  At this level, one is a crucial player on a project and must know the work.  This customized program focuses on leading day-to-day technical and operational activities at the middle manager level. The first cohort for this program is scheduled for Winter/Spring 2021. 
	AEC360 Exec: At executive and senior manager levels, problems are complex.  Our advanced coursework equips business operators and owners with the tools to handle a wide range of high-level technical, commercial, and social issues.  We promote exchange, encourage networking, and facilitate partnerships.  We plan to begin this program as early as Spring 2021. 
	AEC360 Custom: Here, we collaboratively customize programs to address group, individual, or region-specific challenges/needs such as flooding and landslides in mountainous regions.
